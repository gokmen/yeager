# Submitting bugs

Make sure to review these points before submitting issues - thank you!

- Make sure a similar issue doesn't exist yet: use the search box
- **Include reproducible code**: we should be able to paste it into an editor, compile and run it and get the same error as you. Otherwise it's impossible for us to reproduce the bug.
- Reduce code, if possible, to the minimum size that reproduces the bug.
- Include Crystal compiler version (`crystal -v`) and OS.
